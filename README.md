# parsing-tools
My own simple and useful implementation for handling different encoding schemes (right now mainly JSON)

The main goal of this project is that it should be:
1) Easy to use for the developer (simple things should be simple).
2) KISS!
3) Use fluent API's where convenient.
4) Support immutable objects where possible.
5) Readable, predictable code.
6) Use as much of the standard Java API as possible.
7) Use as few external dependancies as possible (although I should never do something that has been done well before).
8) Be compatible with OSGi (e.g. compiled with bndtools)
