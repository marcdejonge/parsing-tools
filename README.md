# parsing-tools
My own simple and useful implementation for handling different encoding schemes (right now mainly JSON)

The main goal of this project is that it should be:
 - Easy to use for the developer (simple things should be simple).
 - KISS!
 - Use fluent API's where convenient.
 - Support immutable objects where possible.
 - Readable, predictable code.
 - Use as much of the standard Java API as possible.
 - Use as few external dependancies as possible (although I should never do something that has been done well before).
 - Be compatible with OSGi (e.g. compiled with bndtools)
